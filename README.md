Empty Paragraph Killer
======================

Text filter that removes empty paragraphs.

Empty Paragraph Killer is helpful if your writers tend to press return twice 
between paragraphs, resulting in an "empty" paragraph (p nbsp; /p) when the 
content is viewed. This module removes that sort of paragraph.
